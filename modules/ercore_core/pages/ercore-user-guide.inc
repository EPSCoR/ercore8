    t('<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This guide has been developed for first time users of the EPSCoR Core
Reporting site (ERCore).  This site has been developed using Drupal 7, an
open-source content management system. Whether you are a developer, tester,
administrator or an end user, we all need to get familiar with Drupal first.
In addition, this guide also introduces important terms used by the NSF EPSCoR
program and how those terms are interpreted by the system.  This relationship
is important for system administrators to understand to be able to deliver
reporting data to NSF with confidence.</p><p>In general, most of the data
requested by this reporting system will be viewable by the public, but in order
to enter new, edit, or download the compiled tables you will need to have an
account and be logged in.</p>
<h2 id="request-account">Request an Account</h2>
<ul>
<li>In your web browser, visit your jurisdiction\'s hosted Drupal site. For UNH
go to http://solstice.sr.unh.edu/</li>
<li>Select on the "<em>Create new account</em>" link located in the gray box at
the top left hand side of the home page. <strong>This varies by site.</strong>
</li>
<li>There are 4 fields that require information:
    <ol>
     <li>The name field is required. The title, generational, and credentials
     portions of this field are optional,</li>
		<li>Email: a unique email address for each individual</li>
		<li>Username: a unique value for each individual. This is not displayed.
		</li>
		<li>Participating Institution. If your institution is not on the list, talk
		to a site administrator.</li>
		<li>Department: The department field is optional, but can be helpful for
		grouping or differentiating people.</li>
		</ol>
</li>
<li>Click on Create New Account when you are done. This generates an email sent
to the Web Master who needs to approve the request. </li>
<li>An email will be sent when your account is approved</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="log-in">Log In</h2>
<p>Once the Web Master has approved your account, an email will be sent to you.
In it will be directions to log in and include a link to visit the site.  In
this example we use the New Hampshire\'s development site.  In your web browser,
visit the URL to your jurisdiction\'s web site.  Your program administrator
needs to give this to you.</p>
<h2 id="user">User Profile</h2>
<p>The system greatly depends on complete and accurate user data.  Please
complete all the fields presented to you in the user profile.  The final data
is only as good as the data you enter.</p>
<p>After you login you will be taken to your User Profile home page.  At any
point in time you need to get back to your user account, scroll to the top of
any page and look in the black menu bar for your user name.  It actually
says, "<em>Hello (user)</em>".  Click on your name and you will be taken to your
user account.</p>
<p>Near your user-name is a row of tabs. The most important of those are the View and
the Edit tabs.  Clicking either will give you that functionality (click Edit to
edit, and View to view your profile\'s content).</p>
<p>Below your photo (once you have uploaded one) is a block of horizontal tabs
of grouped information. The other tabs are Contact, Demographics, EPSCoR
Involvement,  Institution, and Data Collection.  Clicking on those tabs will
take you to that information.  Once in a View of our choice, clicking on Edit
will allow you to edit that content.</p>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<ol><li>Select on the "<em>Hello (Your name)</em>" link at the top right of any
page (after you are logged in)</li>
<li>Select on the Edit tab</li>
<li>Select on the Contact Information tab if you are not already there</li>
<li>The red asterisk after a field means that the data is required.  You will
not be able to save the form unless all required fields have been completed.</li>
<li>The name field may have been entered to create your account, but it can be
updated, and</li>
<li>Phone fields (mobile and work), Work Address and Professional Link are
optional fields.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Demographics</h3>
<p>NSF requires that we try to obtain demographic data for all our participants,
including those attending EPSCoR sponsored events.  Given such a requirement,
it is OPTIONAL to you if you want to submit it or not.  This data will be

entries will be submitted to NSF.</p>

Reporting Core module. The standard roles are as follows:

  <li>Anonymous User:  This role is used for users that don\'t have a user
  account or that are not authenticated.</li>
	<li>Authenticated user:  This role is automatically granted to all logged
	in users(simply means that you have an account in Drupal). </li>
  <li>Guest: Very limited role with access to view ERCore module functionality
  only. </li>
  <li>Student:  Identical to Faculty out - of - the - box. An important
  designation technically, but left up to the jurisdiction to further restrict
  or grant access to specific areas.</li>
  <li>Faculty:  A subset of EPSCoR Administrator generally restricting the
  ability to edit other\'s content</li>
	<li>Administrator Staff: A subset of Site Administrator and EPSCoR
	Administrator, restricting access to the more technical aspects of Drupal and
	EPSCoR reporting</li>
 	<li>Administrator: Access to any and all Drupal capabilities</li></ul>
